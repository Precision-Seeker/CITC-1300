                <ul>
                    <li>Internet Access: ISPs provide users with the means to connect to the internet. This access can be delivered through various technologies, 
                        including DSL (Digital Subscriber Line), cable, fiber optics, satellite, wireless (Wi-Fi), and dial-up. The choice of technology depends on 
                        factors such as location, speed requirements, and available infrastructure.</li>

                    <li>Data Transmission: ISPs act as intermediaries that transmit data between users and the internet.
                         They provide the necessary infrastructure and network equipment to ensure data packets are routed efficiently
                          to their intended destinations on the internet.</li>

                    <li>IP Address Assignment: ISPs assign unique IP (Internet Protocol) addresses to their customers. 
                        IP addresses are essential for identifying and locating devices on the internet.
                         ISPs often provide both dynamic and static IP addresses based on user requirements.</li>

                    <li>Domain Name Services (DNS): ISPs typically run DNS servers that translate 
                        human-readable domain names (e.g., www.example.com) into IP addresses
                         (e.g., 192.168.1.1). This translation allows users to access websites and services
                          using familiar domain names.</li>

                    <li>Email Services: Many ISPs offer email services to their subscribers. 
                        This includes email account setup, email storage, and email forwarding. 
                        Some ISPs also provide spam filtering and virus scanning for email traffic.</li>

                    <li>Web Hosting: Some ISPs offer web hosting services, allowing customers
                         to host their websites and web applications on the provider's servers. 
                         This is especially useful for businesses and individuals looking to establish an online presence.</li>

                    <li>Security Services: ISPs may offer security features such as firewall protection,
                         antivirus software, and virtual private network (VPN) services to help users
                          protect their devices and data from online threats.</li>

                    <li>Content Delivery: Some large ISPs are involved in content delivery networks 
                        (CDNs), which help deliver web content, videos, and streaming services more 
                        efficiently by caching content on servers located closer to end-users.</li>
