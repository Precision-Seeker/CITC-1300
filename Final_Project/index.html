            <h1> Bledsoe Telephone Cooperative Inc. (BTC Fiber)</h1>
            <p> Bledsoe Telephone Cooperative (BTC) is a telecommunications company based in Pikeville, Tennessee,
                 USA. BTC provides a range of communication services to residents and businesses in and around
                  Bledsoe County, Tennessee. These services typically include:

                Landline Telephone Service: BTC offers traditional landline telephone services, allowing customers
                 to make voice calls using landline phones.
                
                Internet Service: Many rural telephone cooperatives, like BTC, have expanded their offerings to
                 include broadband internet services. These services may include DSL, fiber-optic, or wireless
                  internet options, depending on the area they serve.
                
                Television Services: Some telephone cooperatives also provide cable television or IPTV
                 (Internet Protocol Television) services to their subscribers, along with bundled packages 
                 that include internet and phone services.
                
                Bledsoe Telephone Cooperative, like many other rural telecommunications cooperatives,
                 plays a vital role in providing essential communication services to rural and underserved areas, where 
                 larger commercial telecommunications providers may not find it economically viable to operate. These
                  cooperatives are often community-owned or member-owned organizations that focus on meeting the communication
                   needs of their local communities. Please note that specific services and coverage areas may vary, so it's a
                    good idea to check with BTC directly or visit their website for the most up-to-date information regarding 
                    the services we offer. </p>

            <p> Base, XLT, and Limited trims come with a 300-hp turbocharged 2.3-liter four-cylinder engine, and it motivates the Explorer with authority.
                 The lead-foot drivers among us will prefer either the Platinum model, with its 365-hp twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6, or the sporty Explorer ST, which uses a 400-hp version of the same engine.
                  A hybrid joined the Explorer lineup for 2020. It pairs a 3.3-liter V-6 engine with an electric motor for a combined output of 318 horsepower. When properly equipped, the Explorer can tow up to 5600 pounds.
                   The Explorer rides on an all-new rear-wheel-drive platform, but all-wheel drive is still optional. A 10-speed automatic transmission is standard across the board. Ride and handling are agreeable and composed but far from entertaining;
                    the Explorer ST is far more athletic, and its extra power and stiffer suspension make it a real performance SUV. </p>

            <h3>Voice</h3>
            <p>It's important to note that while POTS is less common today than in the past, it still exists in some areas, 
                especially in rural and remote locations where other forms of communication infrastructure may be limited. Additionally,
                 POTS lines are sometimes used for purposes other than traditional voice calls, such as for alarm systems and fax machines.</p>

            <h4>Data</h4>
            <p>Fiber internet, also known as fiber-optic internet, is a type of high-speed broadband internet connection
                 that uses fiber-optic cables to transmit data at extremely fast speeds. It is considered one of the fastest
                  and most reliable internet technologies available today. </p>

            <h5>Video</h5>
            <p>It's important to note that the availability of IPTV services,
                 as well as the channel offerings and features, may vary depending on the service provider and location. 
                 IPTV has become increasingly popular due to its flexibility and the ability to deliver a diverse range of content over IP networks, 
                 making it a competitive alternative to traditional cable and satellite TV services.</p>
