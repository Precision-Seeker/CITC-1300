        <h3>Random Information about The Ford Explorer</h3>
        <p>
            The early 1990s saw a surge in the sales of SUVs, and the Ford Explorer played a role in that. The 2020 model is packed with desirable features. 
            
    The Ford is designed specifically for transporting families, with three rows of seating and tons of cargo capacity.
             A decent turbocharged four-cylinder, a cost-effective hybrid alternative, and a potent twin-turbo V-6 are among its available powertrains. 
             The wide range of options available for the Explorer offers something for everyone in addition to a smooth ride and a distinctive sport-tuned model.
              Additionally, it comes with a ton of standard features like Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, automated emergency braking, and blind-spot monitoring. 
              The SUV that started it all, the 2020 Explorer, despite its lackluster cabin and cramped third row

        <h3> Additional Information</h3>
    
        
        <p> The finest Explorer for the money, in our opinion, is the mid-range Limited variant. Additionally, 
            it is the only one with the $4150 additional hybrid powertrain that is offered. Although the hybrid makes sense for drivers who can benefit 
            from its impressive EPA-rated city mpg, we discovered that the basic turbocharged four-cylinder engine is more powerful and efficient on the interstate. 
            Likewise, even with the towing package installed, it can still tow a massive 5300 pounds. For an extra $2,000, we'd add all-wheel drive. Aside from that,
             we'd stick with the appealing basic features of the Limited trim. These include a power-folding third row, leather upholstery, 
             a heated and power-adjustable steering wheel, a 12-speaker B&O audio system, 20-inch wheels, and improved driver assistance features like adaptive cruise control.</p>
