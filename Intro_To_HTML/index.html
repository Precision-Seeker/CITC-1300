        The Ford Model T was introduced to the world in 1908. Henry Ford wanted the
        Model T to be aFORDable, and simple to use, and also most inportant durable.
        Due to the mass production of the vehicle Ford Motor Company could sell the 
        vehicle between $260 - $850. 
    </p>

    <P> There is also a myth that all Model T's were black. While Henry Ford
        did say "Any customer can have a car painted any color that he wants as long
        as it's black" That policy was in place solely for efficiency and uniformity.
        After 1925 the car was offered in Black, Blue, Red, Grey, and Green.
