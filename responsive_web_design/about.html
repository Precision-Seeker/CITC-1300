            <p> Because the Explorer has proved so popular with baby-boomers and berserko four-wheelers alike, we took delivery of a 1990 crystal-blue Explorer XLT 
                for the long term. Our middle-of-the-line Explorer, which had a base price of $20,044, stickered at $22,115, owing to such niceties as a rear-window wiper, 
                a great-sounding Ford/JBL stereo with cassette, a nifty hatch/liftgate combination, and a tow pack­age. We also added a trailer hitch.

                The Explorer drew immediate raves for its carlike interior and accessibility. One staffer noted, though, that the standard 4.0-liter V-6 produced some 
                unwanted noise during the usually serene highway cruise. "There are some rev ranges where the V-6 rumbles more than it should—shades of Bronco II." </p>

            <p> The interior of the Explorer for the 1991 Model Year proved to be groundgreaking especially for the early 90's everone loved the soft cloth seats. That proved well on long road trips.</p>

            <p>Fords 4.0 OHV was no stranger in the 1990's. Ford used this same engine in a lot of their diffrent vehicles for the time, naming a few was the Explorer and Ford Ranger 2WD and 4WD.</p>

            <h3>6 Generations of EXPLORERS</h3>
            <img src="images/6-generations-of-the-ford-explorer.webp" alt="6 Generations of the Ford Explorer">
            <p> The Ford Explorer is often considered an iconic SUV, especially in the United States. It was one of the first SUVs to gain widespread popularity in the early 1990s when it was introduced as a 
                family-friendly alternative to traditional truck-based SUVs. The Explorer played a significant role in popularizing the SUV segment, and it has a long and successful history in the automotive market.

                Over the years, the Ford Explorer has gone through several generations and changes in design and features. It has been a top-selling SUV for many years, and its nameplate is well-recognized. 
                However, whether it is considered iconic can be somewhat subjective and dependent on personal opinions and regional perspectives. Nonetheless, it has certainly made a significant impact in the
                 SUV market and is a recognizable and influential model in the automotive industry.</p>
