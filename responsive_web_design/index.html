            <h1> Ford Explorer</h1>
            <p> Ford has made a few tweaks to its mid-size crossover for 2021, such as making heated seats standard on the XLT, 
                offering a heated steering wheel as an optional feature on that model, and including an eight-way power-adjustable 
                front passenger's seat on the Limited, ST, and Platinum models. A Sport Appearance package is now available on the XLT trim, 
                and it includes 20-inch aluminum wheels that are coated in Carbonized Gray paint. In addition to the upgraded wheels, the
                 package also brings a mesh grille with Carbonized Gray accents as well as unique lower-body cladding, dual exhaust outlets,
                  Light Slateâ€“colored interior upholstery, faux skid plates, and more. A new cargo organizer is optional on XLT, Limited, and
                   ST models; the Platinum trim receives this feature as standard. A high-end King Ranch trim joins the lineup and features unique mahogany-colored 
                   leather upholstery; a sporty Enthusiast ST trim is also new for 2021 and provides the performance of the more expensive ST trim with less features 
                   and a lower price. Off-road enthusiasts may find the new Timberline trim interesting; it features a lifted suspension, all-terrain tires, and more
                    rugged exterior styling cues. The hybrid powertrain is now available on the Platinum trim and, speaking of Platinum, buyers can now order a rear-wheel
                     drive version of the Explorer's top trim. Ford also says an all-electric variant of the Explorer is on the way, but we don't expect to see that until at
                      least the 2022 model year. </p>
            <img src="images/SilverST.jpg" alt="Explorer ST">
            <p> Base, XLT, and Limited trims come with a 300-hp turbocharged 2.3-liter four-cylinder engine, and it motivates the Explorer with authority.
                 The lead-foot drivers among us will prefer either the Platinum model, with its 365-hp twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6, or the sporty Explorer ST, which uses a 400-hp version of the same engine.
                  A hybrid joined the Explorer lineup for 2020. It pairs a 3.3-liter V-6 engine with an electric motor for a combined output of 318 horsepower. When properly equipped, the Explorer can tow up to 5600 pounds.
                   The Explorer rides on an all-new rear-wheel-drive platform, but all-wheel drive is still optional. A 10-speed automatic transmission is standard across the board. Ride and handling are agreeable and composed but far from entertaining;
                    the Explorer ST is far more athletic, and its extra power and stiffer suspension make it a real performance SUV. </p>

            <h3>King Ranch</h3>
            <p>The 2021 Ford Explorer is adding a King Ranch model to its lineup. The luxurious package, named for an actual ranch in Texas, 
                has been offered on Ford's F-series trucks for 20 years as well as on the Expedition full-size SUV. The Explorer could see an off-road-focused model 
                called Timberline soon as well. The Explorer King Ranch will sit just under the Explorer Platinum 4WD as the second most expensive model in the Explorer's 
                lineup when it goes on sale in the spring starting at $53,595. The 2021 Explorers recently received price cuts and now start at $33,470.</p>

            <h4>King Ranch Interior</h4>
            <p>The King Ranch's seats and center console are wrapped in Mahogany leather with the Running W logos, and the dash is trimmed with sapele wood. 
                The steering wheel is also wrapped in leather with a wood insert and a King Ranch logo. Ford's premium technology package is available, adding 
                massaging front seats, a 10.1-inch vertically oriented touchscreen (an 8.0-inch screen is standard), and a Bang & Olufsen sound system.</p>

            <h5>King Ranch Towing</h5>
            <p>King Ranch Explorers get a gray grille insert, four chrome exhaust tips, King Ranch badging, and 20-inch wheels with the King Ranch "Running W" logo, 
                which is said to represent either a rattlesnake or the Santa Gertrudis Creek near the actual King Ranch. Both rear- and four-wheel drive models are available, 
                powered by Ford's twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter EcoBoost V-6 that makes 365 horsepower and 380 pound-feet of torque. This is the first time rear-wheel drive has been 
                teamed with Ford's 3.0-liter EcoBoost, the automaker said. A 10-speed automatic transmission sends power to the wheels, and King Ranches can tow up to 5600 pounds.</p>
